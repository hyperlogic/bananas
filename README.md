Bananas
==========

Monkeys love bananas, parenthesis, not so much.

TODO
-----------

* sequence
* eval bootstrap.ooo
* first class envs - eval and apply should take env argument, make-env
* recursive def

Code Review
----------------
* What is the minimal set of prims that we need?
* should we try kernal style $vau?

Exceptions
----------------
Make this work. somehow. setjmp, longjmp?

Immediate values
-------------------
Is there some hacky way to use doubles or floats as immediate values?  Nans?

Macros
-------------------
These are nice to play with.
